Properly written version of Skin Chooser 2


This is a console application written in C# that chooses and displays a random skin (that I own) for any champion in League of Legends. This is a re-written and expanded version of my original program, 'Skin Chooser 2', which is also public.

The program's Changelog (currently embedded in the code) describes better in detail what changes have been made.
